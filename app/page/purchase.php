    <h3>Buying</h3>
    <p>
        Although my music available on many music platforms - if you decide to buy some <em>(thank you!)</em>, consider doing so through
        <a href="//spartalien.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, since only there I can include bonus material for digital releases.
        You'll also have it in your Bandcamp collection then - so you can always stream and/or (re)download it at any time in various formats (also through phone apps + no subscription needed)
