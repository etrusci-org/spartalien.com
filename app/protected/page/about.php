    <h2>WHY / ROOTS / EXTENDED "IN A NUTSHELL"</h2>
    <p><em>(This is an excerpt from the <a href="<?php print($this->routeURL('stuff/id:11')); ?>">Shikantaza Creativity Interview.</a>)</em></p>
    <p>I became really infected with the digital virus around in the late 90s when I built my first computer. A year or two later I started taking photos and manipulating them digitally. I also had a few printed, which allowed me to bring the digital into the real world. Then I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> and started learning a little bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a>. Since I had fun coding, I decided to learn the basics of web development because I needed a website to show my pictures to other people. In general, I was fascinated by the flow of information on the Internet. That distance is no longer a real hurdle when it comes to data transmission.</p>
    <p>I've always loved music as a listener and small collector. I was then and still am one of those people who never go out of the house for long periods of time without a Walkman. Music production came into play when a couple of friends set up a small studio where they produced Techno/Psy. When I was there for the first time, I knew immediately that I wanted to try it too. <a href="<?php print($this->routeURL('stuff/id:3')); ?>">A few old tracks</a> from back then are still available on my website.</p>
    <p>From then on, many of my projects have developed in the direction of music. The input for a program was often music metadata or it was a website that was about music in some way or another. But since I was still at the very beginning of my learning process, I kept discarding practically everything in order to improve it or to learn new things. Around 2001, I started a web radio with friends, which was online for several years. The music was mainly Downtempo, Trip-Hop, IDM and Ambient. Promos from unknown artists from around the world were also broadcasted.</p>
    <p>The atmosphere, the feeling I got from this time - how the music finds me and not the other way around, how it can change people's thoughts - has never left me since then.</p>
